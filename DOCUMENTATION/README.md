## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Multi-Tenancy
The system supports multiple independent organizations (LGUs, training centers). Each tenant:
- Has isolated data and users
- Manages their own programs and trainees
- Has independent branding and settings
- Cannot see other tenants' data

### User Roles (5 Levels)
1. **Super Admin** - Platform administrator (all tenants)
2. **Local Admin** - Organization administrator (single tenant)
3. **Staff Training Coordinator** - Attendance and program coordination
4. **Staff Inventory Manager** - Equipment and materials management
5. **Trainee** - Training participant

### Workflow: Registration → Approval → Training → Completion
1. Trainee self-registers online
2. Local admin approves/rejects registration
3. Approved trainees gain login access
4. Trainees enroll in programs
5. Daily attendance tracking begins
6. Certificate generated upon completion

## 🛡️ Security Overview

The system implements enterprise-grade security:

- **Encrypted Authentication**: JWT tokens with AES-256 encryption
- **Tenant Isolation**: Database-level row-level security (RLS)
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permission control per feature
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with 12 salt rounds
- **Session Management**: Short-lived tokens with auto-refresh
- **Audit Logging**: All actions logged with timestamps and user IDs
- **Data Validation**: Zod schema validation on all inputs

**Full Details:** [Security & Authentication](./06-SECURITY-AUTHENTICATION.md)
